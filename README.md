# Eris

Once upon a time, Pluto was the farthest. We loved Pluto as being the last 
of our celestial uncles.... Untill one day, Pluto was no longer considered
part of the family. It existed, but was not mentioned anymore... no longer
invited to family parties. It became history.

After many years, astronomers discovered Eris... it was farther than Pluto,
but oh so similar. 

This is the story of Eris.
